# Type Erasure and Generics

## Setup

Ensure you have run `npm i` at the root of this project
Ensure you have `@nestjs/cli` installed (I just find it easier to work with)

## First Step

Review the `examples.ts` as it provides some pretty basic examples using Generic arguments

## Second Step

Run `nest build`
Followed by `ndoe src/00-ts-basics/01-generics/examples`

You should see how the generics changed between typescript and the compiled java script

Look ove the files in this project. See if you can spot where pain points might be.
